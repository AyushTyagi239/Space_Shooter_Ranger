# Space_Shooter_Ranger
A classic arcade-style game where the player controls a spaceship, dodges enemy fire, and shoots back against an infinite wave of enemies.

What I did:

Developed the full game mechanics using C#

Designed an infinite enemy spawn system

Implemented responsive shooting and dodging controls

Built smooth 2D movement and visual effects

Focused on gameplay balance and performance optimization


This project really boosted my hands-on experience with Unity and real-time game logic.

Tools & Tech: Unity, C#

Excited to share more projects and connect with other game developers!
